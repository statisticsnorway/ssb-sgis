    """Filter a GeoDataFrame or GeoSeries by spatial predicate.

    Does an sjoin and returns the rows of 'gdf' that were returned
    without getting duplicates or columns from 'other'.
    Works with unique and non-unique index.

    Like 'select by location' in ArcGIS/QGIS, except that the
    selection is permanent.

    Args:
        gdf: The GeoDataFrame.
        other: The geometry object to filter 'gdf' by.
        predicate: Spatial predicate to use. Defaults to 'intersects'.
        distance: Max distance to allow if predicate=="dwithin".
        n_jobs: Number of workers.
        rtree_runner: Optionally debug/manipulate the spatial indexing operations.
            See the 'runners' module for example implementations.

    Returns:
        A copy of 'gdf' with only the rows matching the
        spatial predicate with 'other'.

    Examples:
    ---------
    >>> import sgis as sg
    >>> df1 = sg.to_gdf([(0, 0), (0, 1)])
    >>> df1
                      geometry
    0  POINT (0.00000 0.00000)
    1  POINT (0.00000 1.00000)
    >>> df2 = sg.to_gdf([(0, 0), (1, 2)])
    >>> df2
                      geometry
    0  POINT (0.00000 0.00000)
    1  POINT (1.00000 2.00000)

    Keep rows in df1 intersecting any geometry in df2.

    >>> sg.sfilter(df1, df2)
                      geometry
    0  POINT (0.00000 0.00000)

    Equivelent to sjoin-ing and selecting based on integer index
    (in case of non-unique index).

    >>> df1["idx"] = range(len(df1))
    >>> joined = df1.sjoin(df2)
    >>> df1.loc[df1["idx"].isin(joined["idx"])].drop(columns="idx")
                          geometry
    0  POINT (0.00000 0.00000)

    Also equivelent to using the intersects method, which
    is often a lot slower since df2 must be dissolved:
